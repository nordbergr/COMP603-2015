It is amazing that a compiler is written in the language it compiles..This means the compiler
must compile itself?

I am looking at cpython

2. The Grammar file is the parsing aspect of the compiler, as well as the Parser folder.
   I assume the ast.c (in the Python folder) file corresponds to the ast aspect of the compiler.
   Also, the compile.c file corresponds to the AST of the compiler.
   I thought Peephole was a funny file name in the Python folder but the comment says it optimizes      for bytecode compiler, so I'm guessing that is the optimization part of the compiler.
